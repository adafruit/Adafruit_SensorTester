Adafruit_SensorTester
=====================

A simple, minimal driver template to implement a driver based on the [Adafruit unified sensor driver system](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Sensor).

This code shows the minimum requirements of what needs to be added to your existing driver, using a sample driver called Adafruit_SensorTester (rename this to something more appropriate yourself).
